  <p>somewhateverlasting is an experimental webcomic where I make whatever I feel like making.</p>
  <p>I began it with the hope of improving my art and writing skills over time. That way, once this webcomic starts getting really good, I could look back at the start and cringe at how terrible this webcomic was at the beginning.</p>
